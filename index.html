                You stand on the boat looking over the sunset before stepping into the submarine and closing the door behind you. The boat slowly lets you down into the water to set off on your journey.

                You have started your journey and reached the depth of many marine life, as well as the depth of many recreational divers. The sun still shines through the water at this level.

                You begin to descend to depths that exceed the human limit. Most highly experienced divers only reach depths of a little under 100 meters at the most. This is the end of the sunlight zone and the beginning of the twilight zone. As you descend further, the sunlight will only penetrate less and less.

                You are fully emersed into the Twilight Zone now. There is still a lot of marinelife all around you. Slowly but surely, any remnants of sunlight fades into darkness.

            <p>
                Your smile slowly fades as you realize that there is no more sunlight. If you thought the Twilight Zone was dark, then you're in for a treat. You begin to descend further than the Twilight Zone and make it into the Midnight Zone, where normal marinelife as we know it ceases to exist. Instead, most of the organisms down here have some sort of bioluminescence. This is the depth at where Sperm Whales hunt Giant Squid.
